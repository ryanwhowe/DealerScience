Exercise 2: 
=====
DNA sequences are strings which contain only the letters A, C, G, and T.  Two sequences are considered akin if they both contain sub-sequences which form an anangram of each other (e.g. ACG, GAC, GCA, and etc. ).

In two given DNA sequences find the largest possible sub-sequence that would be considered akin.  Output the length of the akin sub-sequence and its position (0-based) in both intput sequences.


Exercise 4: 
=====
if all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

Note: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.  For this exercise you should use "and" when writing out numbers in compliance with British usage.

Example:
1,2,3,4,5 = 'one' + 'two' + 'three' + 'fout' + 'five' = 'onetwothreefourfive' = 19 letters
